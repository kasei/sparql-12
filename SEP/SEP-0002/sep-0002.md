# Add Support Durations, Dates, and Times

* Short Name: date-time-arithmetic
* SEP Number: [SEP-0002](sep-0002.md)
* Author: [Gregory Todd Williams](https://github.com/kasei)

## *Notes*

*This might be affected by work on [sparql-12#97](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-12/issues/97) (supporting XPath 3.1).* For the purposes of this SEP, it is assumed that XPath 3.1 is *not* supported, and existing SPARQL semantics continue to be based on [XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/).

*Not all of the relevant operators are described below or implemented in the linked tests, but the tests repo does list them in the [README](https://github.com/kasei/sparql-12/blob/xsd_datetime_duration/tests/xsd_functions/README.md).*

## Abstract

Update SPARQL to better support handling of duration, date, and time values.
This would add new supported datatypes `xsd:time`, `xsd:date`, `xsd:duration`,
and the two derived types `xsd:dayTimeDuration`, and `xsd:yearMonthDuration`.
New functions and operators for working with these types would be added,
drawn from the [XPath and XQuery Functions and Operators][xpfo]
(similar to existing functions and operators already supported in SPARQL 1.1).

## Motivation

As raised in [sparql-12#32](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-12/issues/32), the support in SPARQL 1.1 for `xsd:dateTime` allows only a
narrow range of queries, and is often insufficient to express queries over
temporal data. Among other limitations, the supported types, functions, and operators
available in SPARQL 1.1:

* cannot be used with `xsd:date` values
* cannot be used with `xsd:time` values
* cannot perform arithmetic operations over temporal values (computing differences, adding/subtracting durations)
* cannot extract components from `xsd:date` values
* cannot extract components from `xsd:time` values

This proposal would improve SPARQL's support for temporal data by supporting
common datatypes such as dates, times, and durations, and allow natural
operations over those datatypes (and the already supported dateTime type).

## Rationale and Alternatives

This proposal follows the SPARQL 1.1 spec in natively supporting XPath operators
where appropriate, and in exposing XPath functions using keywords that fit
stylistically with existing functions.

## Evidence of consensus

**TODO: To be filled in when/if such evidence becomes available**

## Specification:

The following datatypes are added to the list of supported [Operand Data Types][odt] and to the list of [XPath Constructor Functions][constr]:

* `xsd:time`
* `xsd:date`
* `xsd:duration`
* `xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:yearMonthDuration`

The following function is added to the [Functions on Dates and Times][datefuncs]:

* `xsd:dateTime ADJUST(xsd:dateTime arg, xsd:dayTimeDuration timezone)`

The following functions are updated in [Functions on Dates and Times][datefuncs] to accept parameters of more types:

* `xsd:integer  YEAR (xsd:date arg)`
* `xsd:integer  MONTH (xsd:date arg)`
* `xsd:integer  DAY (xsd:date arg)`
* `xsd:integer  HOURS (xsd:time arg)`
* `xsd:integer  MINUTES (xsd:time arg)`
* `xsd:decimal  SECONDS (xsd:time arg)`
* `xsd:dayTimeDuration  TIMEZONE (xsd:date arg)`
* `xsd:dayTimeDuration  TIMEZONE (xsd:time arg)`
* `simple literal  TZ (xsd:date arg)`
* `simple literal  TZ (xsd:time arg)`

The following entries are added to the [Operator Mapping][ops] table:

* `xsd:yearMonthDuration < xsd:yearMonthDuration`
* `xsd:yearMonthDuration > xsd:yearMonthDuration`
* `xsd:dayTimeDuration < xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:dayTimeDuration > xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:duration = xsd:duration`
* `xsd:date = xsd:date`
* `xsd:date < xsd:date`
* `xsd:date > xsd:date`
* `xsd:date - xsd:date`
* `xsd:date - xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:date - xsd:yearMonthDuration`
* `xsd:date + xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:date + xsd:yearMonthDuration`
* `xsd:time = xsd:time`
* `xsd:time < xsd:time`
* `xsd:time > xsd:time`
* `xsd:time - xsd:time`
* `xsd:time - xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:dateTime - xsd:dateTime`
* `xsd:dateTime - xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:dateTime - xsd:yearMonthDuration`
* `xsd:dateTime + xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:dateTime + xsd:yearMonthDuration`
* `xsd:dayTimeDuration < xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:dayTimeDuration > xsd:dayTimeDuration`
* `xsd:yearMonthDuration < xsd:yearMonthDuration`
* `xsd:yearMonthDuration > xsd:yearMonthDuration`

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal is purely additive to SPARQL 1.1.
